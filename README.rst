Module Description
------------------

`Grafana <http://grafana.org/>`__ is a web-based metric and analytics display
tool, frequently used for log analysis. This module acts as a SIMP wrapper (or
"profile") for the Puppet, Inc. Approved Grafana module written and maintained
by Bill Fraser and maintained by Vox Pupuli. It sets a baseline of secure
defaults and integrates Grafana with other SIMP components.

This is a SIMP module
---------------------

This module is a component of the
`System Integrity Management Platform <https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP>`__,
a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our
`JIRA <https://simp-project.atlassian.net/>`__.

Please read our
`Contribution Guide <https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Contributing+to+SIMP>`__
and visit our
`developer wiki <https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/SIMP+Development+Home>`__.

This module is optimally designed for use within a larger SIMP ecosystem, but
it can be used independently:

-  As a SIMP wrapper module, the defaults use the larger SIMP ecosystem to
   manage security compliance settings from the Puppet server.

-  If used independently, all SIMP-managed security subsystems may be disabled
   via the ``simp_options::firewall`` and ``simp_options::pki`` settings.

.. note::
  If SIMP integration is not required, use of this module is discouraged;
  direct use of the component Grafana module is advised.

Setup
-----

What simp\_grafana affects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The Grafana package
-  IPTables rules
-  Linux Capabilities for the Grafana server daemon
-  PKI certificates in Grafana's ``/etc/grafana`` directory

Setup Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because this is a SIMP profile module, it assumes basic SIMP components are
already deployed. Namely, it requires the
`IPTables <https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-iptables>`__ and
`PKI <https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-pki>`__ modules. Setup of those
modules is beyond the scope of this document. Please see the component
documentation for more details.

Beginning with simp\_grafana
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming SIMP is deployed, and an Internet connection is available to
download the package files to the intended Grafana server, use of this
module should be as simple as ``include '::simp_grafana'``.

Usage
-----

Aside from the few "passthrough" parameters, any parameter in the
component ``::grafana`` class may be overloaded via Hiera. For example,
the install method may be changed like this:

.. code:: yaml

    ---
    grafana::install_method: 'package'

LDAP configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LDAP authentication is disabled by default, but defaults are pre-seeded
for the SIMP OpenLDAP server using the SIMP-standard Hiera keys. To use
them, simply enable ``simp_options::ldap``.

.. code:: puppet

    # Manifest

    include '::simp_grafana'

.. code:: YAML

    # Hiera data
    ---
    simp_options::ldap: true

This will also set up default group mappings for groups with the CNs
"simp_grafana_admins," "simp_grafana_editors," "simp_grafana_editors_ro,"
and "simp_grafana_viewers."

If `$ldap` is set to true, the ``toml`` gem needs to be installed into the
puppetserver gemset. An RPM called ``rubygem-puppetserver-toml`` is
provided with SIMP 6.2 that automatically installs the gem and its
dependencies into the puppetserver. This RPM and its dependent RPMs can be
found in the 6_X_Dependencies yum repo, available on 
`PackageCloud <https://packagecloud.io/simp-project/6_X_Dependencies>`__.
Install this package using yum:

    ``yum install -y rubygem-puppetserver-toml``

.. note::
    At present the module does not support config merging of servers in
    the ``ldap_cfg`` parameter, so if any changes are made to the default
    server, the entire server must be configured.

.. note::
    Due to the way Puppet 3.x handles data types, Integers in the ``ldap_cfg``
    hash MUST be specified with arithmetic expression or else they will
    be converted to Strings when passed to the Ruby code that generates
    the LDAP configuration file.  For example, to specify the port 8636,
    use the value "8635 + 1" without quotes.

Network-isolated Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an Internet connection is not available, or if review of the package
files is desired, the ``package_source`` parameter to the component
Grafana module may be set. It takes a String that is valid for the
target package provider. For example, Yum can take URLs like
``http://example.com/path/to/rpm`` or ``file:///path/to/rpm``. If a
local HTTP server is unavailable, the file may be installed via Puppet
to a temporary directory. Here is an example:

.. code:: puppet

    # Manifest

    include '::simp_grafana'

    file { '/tmp/grafana_package.rpm':
      ensure => file,
      source => 'puppet:///modules/files/rpms/grafana_package.rpm',
      before => Class['simp_grafana'],
    }

.. code:: yaml

    # Hiera data
    ---
    grafana::package_source: 'file:///tmp/grafana_package.rpm'

Reference
---------

Please see the header content in `manifests/init.pp <manifest/init.pp>`__ for
the most up-to-date documentation. (We'll populate this section once we can
automate it.)

Limitations
-----------

This module has only been tested on CentOS 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Development
-----------

Please see the
`SIMP Contribution Guidelines <https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Contributing+to+SIMP>`__.

Acceptance tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the system tests, you need `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`__
installed. Then, run:

.. code:: shell

    bundle exec rake beaker:suites

Some environment variables may be useful:

.. code:: shell

    BEAKER_debug=true
    BEAKER_provision=no
    BEAKER_destroy=no
    BEAKER_use_fixtures_dir_for_modules=yes
    BEAKER_fips=yes
    BEAKER_spec_prep=no

-  ``BEAKER_debug``: show the commands being run on the STU and their output.
-  ``BEAKER_destroy=no``: prevent the machine destruction after the tests
   finish so you can inspect the state.
-  ``BEAKER_provision=no``: prevent the machine from being recreated.  This can
   save a lot of time while you're writing the tests.
-  ``BEAKER_use_fixtures_dir_for_modules=yes``: cause all module dependencies
   to be loaded from the ``spec/fixtures/modules`` directory, based on the
   contents of ``.fixtures.yml``. The contents of this directory are usually
   populated by ``bundle exec rake spec_prep``. This can be used to run
   acceptance tests to run on isolated networks.
-  ``BEAKER_fips=yes``: enable FIPS-mode on the virtual instances. This can
   take a very long time, because it must enable FIPS in the kernel
   command-line, rebuild the initramfs, then reboot.
-  ``BEAKER_spec_prep=no``: don't populate ``spec/fixtures/modules/`` prior to
   executing the test suite. This can save time on subsequent runs when using
   ``BEAKER_destroy=no BEAKER_provision=no``, however changes to the fixture
   modules will not take effect.
